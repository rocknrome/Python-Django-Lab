# Lab and Homework - MORE PETS
-------

You've created full CRUD for Turtles in today's class, and tonight you'll be creating some company for them by creating the following models with full-crud. Make sure to test each one out in postman. All should have name and age just like turtle.

1. Dogs

2. Cats

3. Birds

** As you get done with the all the endpoints for each, run the server then in a separate terminal run `pytest` in this folder to see if all the routes are working. Make sure pytest and requests are both installed in your current virtual environment.**
